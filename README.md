# US-Financial-Health
In this project, we’ll be importing various types of financial data to try and determine the financial health and volatility of the US between 1999 and 2019.


We’ll use the techniques learned for importing financial data, to import stock and commodity pricing data from csv files and the FRED API. Then grab GDP and goods and services export data from the World Bank API.

Finally, we’ll find the log returns of the imported data, and use that to determine the volatility of the data over the 20 year period.
